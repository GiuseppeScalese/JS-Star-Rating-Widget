Run the basic_carousel.html page and check the project out.

The project has been implemented on Google Chrome, Firefox and Safari. It is fully responsive - mobile version availale.
Also, the test is IE compatible. IE9(included) onwards.

I've used JavaScript, jQuery, SASS, HTML5 and GRUNT as JS task runner. Naming convention followed are BEM, OOCSS and SMACCS.

From the terminal, run "GRUNT" in order to compile the whole project running all tasks.
Otherwise run each task singularly.



IMPORTANT NOTE: I couldn't use the JSON file provided as both Firefox and Chrome block files imported locally. The JSON file should be on a web server to be accesible and usable.
Hence, I've simulated the AJAX call by importing the json snippet in the JavaScript file and parsing it from there. 
As to show I'm fully capable to do it, I've added a piece of code in which I show how I would perform an AJAX call in order to import an external JSON file.
